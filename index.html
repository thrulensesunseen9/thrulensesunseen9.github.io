             <p>For years I dreamt of becoming a coder and I thought of ways to sort of "play" with code and
                I found it facinating! I also want to introduce coding to my family members.</p>
             <p>As a child I dreamt of becoming an engineer and work for NASA. Now as an adult; becoming a Full-Stack Engineer will give me the opportunity for my childhood dream to come to fruition. As I complete the requirements, I will aim to work for SpaceX.
